# Earth-Observation-Science-Practicals
Welcome to the practicals page for your GEOM2084 (Earth Observation Science) at RMIT University. This repository has four practicals. 

Practical 1: In the first practical, we will look into very basics of the Earth Observation using remotely sensed images. We will start with the basics of the Google Earth Engine, JavaScript, learn how to look for images in data catelogue, visualise single and multi-band images, and finish off with band combination to highlight specific features for Earth Observation. 

Practical 2: The practical 2 will take you a bit further where we will look into filtering through the image collection to find the right image, we will then use the cloud-free image to reinforce our learnings of spectral reflectance of common features for Earth Observation such as vegetation, soil, water bodies and finish off by looking into computation of various indices to map vegetation, water, fire etc. 

Practical 3: In the practical 3, we will learn about image classification and accuracy assessment. You will use your theoretical learning and apply them to sample training features, choose a potentially suitable classifier to classify a landscape. This classification will in turn help you to estimate specifc features that you are after. 

Practical 4: About drones
